                <h6>Step 1: Create a new calendar (or use the default one)</h6>
                If you use the default calendar, it wonâ€™t have a proper name or location. You can edit the default calendar or create a new one.

                <h6>Step 3: Share the link to your calendar so people can book appointments</h6>
                When an appointment is booked and confirmed, you will get an email with the details. You can still cancel the appointment afterwards.
